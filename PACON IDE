# PACON-IDE

## 1. Outline

&nbsp;PACON IDE refers to integrated development environment that handles all tasks in a single program which is associated with the development of adaptive applications such as coding, debugging, distributing compilation.  
&nbsp;One of the biggest advantages of PACON IDE is Docker Container, which enables to provide a faster and lighter development environment than usual virtual environment technologies.  
&nbsp;Also, PACON IDE is based on VS Code which is familiar with software developers. For this reason, users can edit source code in real-time, and easy to test for builds through connecting to various software version management programs and external storage systems.
&nbsp;And furthermore diffrent languages are available in PACON IDE besides C++.  
  
## 2. Key Features

- Autocompleting ARA API & Open source API
- Checking AUTOSAR coding rule in real-time
- Debugging
- Supporting various languages (C++, Python, Rust, etc.)
- Connection to network analyzation program (Wireshark)
- Testing for network of Adaptive Application based on virtual ECU  
  
## 3. Benefits

- We provide environment identical to actual target ECU, which brings lower risks for testing.
- Users are able to manage history through connecting to external registry, and to be easy to work with co-workers.
- PACON IDE automacally creates multiple virtual ECU through CI/CD so that it can test for Adaptive Application.  
  
## 4. Creating virtual ECU

- We offer POSIX OS and Target ECU customers use as Virtual ECU Docker Container.
- After testing for the Adaptive Application through virtual ECU, it can be directly applied to actual target ECU.
- Except for basically offering virtual ECU, the work for Target ECU that customers need is provided as a separate service.
